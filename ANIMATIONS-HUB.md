# ANIMATIONS-HUB.md — Proxy Papers animation library

A catalogue of every animation in the Proxy Papers landing page, written as a
context bank for **me** (the agent). It is **not executed** and nothing imports
it — its purpose is that when an animation is referenced in the future, I have the
full picture of what it is, how it's built, and whether a requested change is
feasible.

Entries are added as each section is ported (source: `design-final/scripts/hero.js`
+ the section's CSS). Source CDN versions: GSAP 3.12.5, ScrollTrigger 3.12.5,
Lenis 1.1.18. The port uses GSAP 3.15.x, Lenis 1.3.x via `@gsap/react` `useGSAP`
+ a root `LenisProvider` (one Lenis driven by `gsap.ticker`; `ScrollTrigger.update`
on scroll).

## Entry template

> ### <Animation name>
> - **Where:** section / element(s) it applies to.
> - **User-facing description:** how to describe or request it in plain language.
> - **Trigger:** on load / scroll-trigger (start–end %) / scrub / hover / perpetual.
> - **Mechanics:** GSAP props (from → to), durations, eases, stagger,
>   ScrollTrigger config (trigger, start, end, scrub, pin), any measured values.
> - **Source ref:** function in `design-final/scripts/hero.js` (+ relevant CSS).
> - **Implementation note:** how it's rebuilt in React (`useGSAP` scope, refs,
>   `SplitText`, cleanup).
> - **Feasibility / constraints:** gotchas, dependencies, reduced-motion behavior,
>   what would make a requested variation hard or easy.

## Foundations (shared mechanics)

### Per-word reveal primitive (`.r-word` / `.r-word__in`)
- **Where:** every editorial headline/body that reveals word-by-word.
- **User-facing description:** "words rise up into place from behind a clipped
  line, one after another."
- **Trigger:** varies by section (load or scroll-trigger).
- **Mechanics:** each word is wrapped `<span class="r-word"><span
  class="r-word__in">word</span></span>`; `.r-word` clips (overflow hidden), the
  inner span animates `yPercent: 110/120 → 0` with a per-word `stagger`.
- **Source ref:** `splitWords(el)` in `hero.js`; `.r-word` in `theme.css`.
- **Implementation note:** a `SplitText` component renders the spans at SSR (no
  runtime DOM splitting, no flash); the section's `useGSAP` targets `.r-word__in`
  by ref. Classes are global (in `globals.css`).
- **Feasibility / constraints:** trivially reusable; stagger and direction are
  per-section. Reduced motion → words render in place.

### Lenis smooth scroll + GSAP ticker
- **Where:** whole page.
- **Mechanics:** one Lenis (`duration: 1.8`, easing
  `t => min(1, 1.001 - 2^(-10t))`), driven from `gsap.ticker`; `lenis.on('scroll',
  ScrollTrigger.update)`. Scroll is locked during the onboarding handoff and
  released on ready.
- **Source ref:** `start()` init in `hero.js`.
- **Implementation note:** `src/lib/lenis/LenisProvider.tsx`; scroll-lock control
  added when the onboarding section is ported.
